#### &#9312; LAN TOPOLOGIES<br /><br/>
<ul>
<li><h5>STAR TOPOLOGY</li></h5>
  Devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub

  Any information sent to a device in this topology is sent *via the central device* to which it connects.

  It is more expensive than any of the other topologies.

  Easy to add more devices as the demand for the network increases.

  If the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, other devices will no longer be able to send or receive data. 

<li><h5>BUS TOPOLOGY</li></h5>
 All data travels along the same cable (backbone cable).

 Prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked,  if backbone cable were to break, devices can no longer receive or transmit data along the bus.

 Difficult to identify which device is experiencing issues with data all travelling along the same route.

 Cost-efficient, easy to set up. 

<li><h5>RING TOPOLOGY</li></h5>
</ul>
